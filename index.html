         <h3> Enthusiast Learner </h3>
          <p> I am not an earner but always curious to know something that I don't know. With that curiosity I started learning the web development & hope to complete the same with the help of my Teacher which is not a person but an android application <strong> Programming Hero. </strong> </p>

        <h2> Big Dream </h2>
         <h4> Be Independent </h4>
          <p> I never thought about the dream seriously. I just wanted to be independent by myself to earn livelihood and spend my whole life with my loving family. A Simple Middle Class Family Boy Dream. But I wanted to be independent is the biggest dream that I can ever thought of. Being independent means gathering enough knowledge to do almost all daily life work without any  help. Learning web development is the part of this big plan. </p>
